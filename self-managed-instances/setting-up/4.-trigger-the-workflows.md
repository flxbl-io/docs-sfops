# 4. Trigger the workflows

After setting up your environments and variables, you can deploy sfops using these workflows:

## Building Docker Images and Deploying

### Deploy to Test Environments

**Workflow:** Build & Deploy to Dev Orgs  
**How to trigger:**
1. Go to your sfops repository → Actions tab
2. Select "Build & Deploy to Dev Orgs" from the left sidebar
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Option to skip Docker build if images already exist

This workflow:
- Builds sfops Docker images (sfops and sfops-lite)
- Pushes images to ghcr.io with `development` tag
- Deploys to all environments listed in `TEST_ORGS`

### Deploy to Production Environments

**Workflow:** release-please  
**How to trigger:**
1. Go to Actions → "release-please" from the left sidebar
2. Click "Run workflow" for manual trigger
3. Or it runs automatically on pushes to main branch

This workflow:
- Creates releases using release-please
- Builds and tags Docker images with `latest`
- Deploys to all environments listed in `ORGS`

### Deploy to Single Environment

**Workflow:** Sync Organization  
**How to trigger:**
1. Go to Actions → "Sync Organization" from the left sidebar
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the environment name (must match one in TEST_ORGS or ORGS)
4. Option to skip Docker build

This workflow allows targeted deployment to a specific environment.


{% hint style="warning" %}
These variables will be automatically set up during the set up of sfops in your repository by the FLXBL team.  This guide is only applicable when you are setting up a self managed instance of sfops
