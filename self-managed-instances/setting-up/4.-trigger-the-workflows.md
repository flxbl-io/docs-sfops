# 4. Trigger the workflows

sfops repository contains two GitHub action workflows that need to be triggered to update your 'test' / 'production' repository.

\<your-github-org-url>/[sfops/actions/workflows/trigger-docker.yml](https://github.com/flxbl-io/sfops/actions/workflows/trigger-docker.yml):  Trigger this workflow to trigger the creation of a docker image and push that to your  docker registry, which is ghcr.io

\<your-github-org-url>/[sfops/actions/workflows/build.yaml](https://github.com/flxbl-io/sfops/actions/workflows/build.yaml) : Trigger this workflow to build and deploy sfops-gh-actions to your test repository\
\
\<your-github-org-url>/[sfops/actions/workflows/release-please.yaml](https://github.com/flxbl-io/sfops/actions/workflows/build.yaml) : Trigger this workflow to build and deploy sfops-gh-actions to your production repository\

These variables will be automatically set up during the set up of sfops in your repository by the FLXBL team.  This guide is only applicable when you are setting up a self managed instance of sfops
