# 4. Trigger the workflows

After setting up your environments and variables, you can deploy sfops using this workflow:

## Deploy to All Environments

### Release and Deploy to Environments in ORGS

**Workflow:** release-please  
**How to trigger:**
1. Go to Actions â†’ "release-please" from the left sidebar
2. Click "Run workflow" for manual trigger
3. Or it runs automatically on pushes to main branch

This workflow:
- Creates releases using release-please (when changes are detected)
- For each environment in `ORGS` array:
  - Builds sfops and sfops-lite Docker images from base sfp-pro images
  - Uses `BASE_REGISTRY`, `BASE_REPO`, `BASE_IMAGE_NAME`, and `BASE_LITE_IMAGE_NAME` variables to pull the base images
  - Tags images with version number (e.g., `31.2.0`) and `latest`
  - Pushes built images to ghcr.io
  - Syncs sfops-gh-actions and sfops-dashboard to the environment

**Important for Forked Repositories:**
If you have forked sfp-pro and are using custom image names, ensure you set both:
- `BASE_IMAGE_NAME`: For the main sfops image (defaults to `sfp-pro`)
- `BASE_LITE_IMAGE_NAME`: For the lite sfops image (defaults to `sfp-pro-lite`)

These variables are crucial for clients who have forked sfp-pro with different image names.

**Note:** Add all your environments (production, test, alpha, etc.) to the `ORGS` array variable in your repository settings.

## Troubleshooting Docker Builds

If your Docker build fails with errors like:
- `403 Forbidden` or `not found` for base images: 
  - Ensure `BASE_REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `BASE_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secrets are set correctly
  - Verify the base image exists at the specified registry
  - Check that your PAT has `read:packages` permission for the base registry

- Authentication errors when pushing:
  - Ensure `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_SECRET` secrets are set
  - Verify your PAT has `write:packages` permission

{% hint style="info" %}
**Base Image Configuration:**
- Production uses: `sfp-pro:latest` (or your custom base via BASE_IMAGE_NAME)
- Test/Alpha uses: `sfp-pro-rc:development` (or your custom RC base via BASE_IMAGE_NAME_RC)

These variables will be automatically set up during the set up of sfops in your repository by the FLXBL team. This guide is only applicable when you are setting up a self managed instance of sfops
