# 1. Create repositories

In order to set up sfops in your GitHub organization, you need to set up the following repositories:

| Repository               | Description                                                                                                                               | Comments                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Configure Repository Access for Reusable Workflows

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Step**: After creating the repositories, you MUST configure the sfops-gh-actions repository to allow other repositories to use its reusable workflows. Without this, your project repositories will fail with "workflow was not found" errors.
{% endhint %}

### Configure sfops-gh-actions Repository

1. Navigate to your `sfops-gh-actions` repository
2. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
3. Scroll down to the **"Access"** section at the bottom
4. Select one of these options based on your security requirements:
   - **Accessible from repositories in the '[your-org]' organization** (Recommended)
     - Allows any repository in your organization to use the workflows
     - Access is allowed only from private or internal repositories
   - **Accessible from repositories in the '[your-enterprise]' enterprise**
     - If you're using GitHub Enterprise and want broader access
5. Click **Save** to apply the settings

### Configure sfops-gh-actions-test Repository (if using)

If you created a test repository, repeat the same steps:

1. Navigate to your `sfops-gh-actions-test` repository
2. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
3. In the **"Access"** section, select the same option as above
4. Click **Save**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: These settings only need to be configured once when setting up the repositories. The workflows will be accessible to all repositories in your organization after this configuration.
{% endhint %}
