# Overview

sfops is a collection of reusable Github Actions, Reusable Workflows along with a Github pages hosted website which aims to convert your Github Repo for Salesforce as your ultimate automation and control centre for your developers

### Issue Ops

sfops introduces the concepts of issue ops to Salesforce, where most operational requests are raised as a GitHub issue.  The issues are then picked up by automation with a human in loop so that if the automation fails for any reason, or if the task is overtly complex, your friendly Salesforce admin can always help.  sfops make development-related operations an absolute breeze
