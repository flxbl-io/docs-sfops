Project workflows, situated within your project repository on GitHub, are automated processes triggered by events linked to your repository. These workflows utilizes reusable workflows housed in the `sfops-gh-actions` repository of your organization,

You have the flexibility to tailor these project workflows by incorporating additional jobs. These additional jobs can either depend on the standard 'default' jobs provided or run in parallel, allowing for a customizable and efficient automation setup.

The reusable workflows from `sfops` are designed with particular input requirements and yield specific outputs. This design enables you to leverage these outputs for further automation and integration within your project, ensuring a seamless operational flow.
