# Handling Org-Wide Email Addresses

### Issue Description

OWEA's cannot be created in Scratch Orgs prior to deployment. The following error occurs when Email Alerts are pushed to a Scratch Org without a verified OrgWideEmailAddress.

```
Email Alerts need a verified OrgWideEmailAddress
```

### Workaround

Handle all emails that would use an OWEA at the Apex level.

* Create an apex class that queries for the OWEA desired.
* If found -> use it as the from address.
* If not found (e.g. scratch org) -> use the current userâ€™s email address as the from address
* Add the InvocableMethod decorator to enable calling from flows

Example

```sql
Messaging.SingleEmailMessage mail = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();

OrgWideEmailAddress[] owea = [select Id from OrgWideEmailAddress where Address = 'owea@test.com'];

if ( owea.size() > 0 ) {
    mail.setOrgWideEmailAddressId(owea.get(0).Id);
} 

mail.toAddresses = new String[] { <contact ID> };
mail.subject = 'OWEA Test Message';
mail.plainTextBody = 'This is the message body.';

Messaging.SingleEmailMessage[] messages = new List<Messaging.SingleEmailMessage> {mail};
Messaging.SendEmailResult[] results = Messaging.sendEmail(messages);
```
